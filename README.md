	<p>
Synthaly Moderation is an administrative system created for your roblox game, it has the purpose of giving people powers and giving people commands to do things. Synthaly Moderation is also used to do things you would usually have to make many scripts for, for example, if you want to change a leader board stat Synthaly can do that, if you want to add custom commands, you can script them yourself too.
Synthaly Moderation has a lot of possibility and potential, it is also the best admin system out there.

	<h2>Installation</h2>
To set Synthaly Moderation up, you will need to own the model above. Once you do, copy/insert the model in your game.

You will now notice a `Model` named `Synthaly Moderation`. Inside of that you should also notice a `Folder` called `Ungroup in ServerScriptService`, make sure that you place and ungroup it inside of `ServerScriptService`.

Once all the assets from `Ungroup in ServerScriptService` are placed inside of `ServerScriptService`, you will **need to enable *Allow HTTP Requests* and *Enable Studio Access to API Services*** in the `Security` tab of the `Game Settings` menu.

Once you have done that, you should also notice a `Folder` called `Ungroup in ChatModules`, make sure that you place and ungroup it inside of the `ChatModules` `Folder` in the `Chat` section of Roblox Studio in order to add the advanced chat filter (this is optional).

Once you finish that, you can consider that Synthaly Moderation is installed. The system can now operate, however, you will still want to configure the settings. To do this, open the `Settings` file in both  the `Synthaly Admin` `Folder` and the `Synthaly Panel` `Folder` located in the `Synthaly Moderation` `Folder` inside of `ServerScriptService`. Customize the settings - everything is explained inside the settings and config script (comments).
